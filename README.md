# TutorManagement-Final-Version
Project Final Version 


PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE:
The perspective of this web application is to give a platform to the tutors as well
as to the students where tutors can register themselves and able to create their courses which they want to teach to the students. 
Tutors can also create lessons for the classes that they just created, also they are able to see how many and which students registered that course. 
Just like that students will also be able to register themselves and can see all the available courses that they can book.
Students will be able to see the lessons for the courses that they registered for themselves. 
They can cancel any course registration that they donâ€™t want anymore.
